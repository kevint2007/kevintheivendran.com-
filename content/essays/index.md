Welcome to my essay collection — a space where I explore complex intersections between climate tech, equity, and innovation. I write to make sense of difficult questions, build clarity from chaos, and share ideas that might spark something in someone else.

Here are a few recent pieces:

---

### 🌍 Energy Transitions Beyond the West
A look at how developing economies are leapfrogging fossil infrastructure with decentralized clean energy — and why Western models often miss the mark.

### 🧠 Can AI Predict Food Insecurity?
How machine learning tools are helping NGOs and policymakers anticipate regional food shortages — and the ethical gray zones we must navigate.
